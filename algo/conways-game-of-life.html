    <h1>Conwayâ€™s Game of Life</h1>
    <p><strong>Category:</strong> Cellular Automaton, Simulation</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Zero-player game simulating cell evolution on a grid based on simple rules.</p>

    <p><strong>ðŸ“¦ Business Case (Where & How to Use):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Warehouse Robotics (Kiva Bots):</strong> Amazon can simulate how robots move inside warehouses using Game of Life rules. Each robot can be thought of as a "live" cell, and the grid helps model paths, avoid congestion, and prevent collisions â€” just like cells dying due to overcrowding.</li>
      <li><strong>Supply Chain Optimization:</strong> Think of each cell as a warehouse. Using Game of Life logic, Amazon can model inventory movement across fulfillment centers. For example, a "dead" (empty) warehouse surrounded by "live" (stocked) warehouses might be restocked â€” like the reproduction rule in GoL.</li>
      <li><strong>Server/Node Health Monitoring (AWS):</strong> In Amazon Web Services (AWS), each server or node can be treated as a cell. If a server fails (dead cell), and neighboring nodes are also under stress, it can simulate failure propagation or trigger auto-scaling. This helps in designing more resilient systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer Behavior Prediction:</strong> Each customer can be represented as a cell. If surrounding users buy a product (live), the current user might also get influenced and buy it. This helps simulate product virality, social trends, and recommendation effects.</li>
      <li><strong>Training & Simulation for Engineers:</strong> Amazon can use the Game of Life as a teaching tool for new engineers or interns. Itâ€™s a simple way to explain complex systems, emergent behavior, and distributed decision-making in a visually intuitive way.</li>
      <li><strong>AI/ML Simulation:</strong> Game of Life-like environments can be used to train AI agents in simulations. This helps test how autonomous agents interact with others in a dynamic system â€” useful in reinforcement learning and research.</li>
    </ul>

      <summary>ðŸ§  How It Works?</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is a <strong>zero-player game</strong> designed by British mathematician <strong>John Conway</strong> in 1970. It's a <strong>cellular automaton</strong> â€” a simulation where a grid of cells evolves over time based on a set of simple rules.</li>
        <li>The game takes place on a <strong>grid</strong> (like a chessboard), where each <strong>cell</strong> is either Alive (1) or Dead (0).</li>
        <li>Each cellâ€™s state in the <strong>next generation</strong> is determined by its <strong>eight neighbors</strong> (cells around it).</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <b>Rules of the Game:</b>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Underpopulation:</strong> A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.</li>
        <li><strong>Survival:</strong> A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors lives on.</li>
        <li><strong>Overpopulation:</strong> A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.</li>
        <li><strong>Reproduction:</strong> A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <pre>
Gen 1:         Gen 2:
0 1 0          0 0 0
0 1 0   --->   1 1 1
0 1 0          0 0 0
      </pre>
      <p>This is called a <strong>blinker</strong>, one of the simplest oscillators.</p>
